# logistic-tracking

The “Logistic Tracking” application is a logistics management solution that utilizes Google Maps API and MongoDB technology. This application is designed to track and recap shipment data efficiently.

The main features of this application involve uploading Excel files containing shipment data, which will then be processed and stored in the MongoDB database. Users can easily monitor and view information related to shipments, including the sender and receiver locations on the Google Maps map.

This application not only stores shipment data, but also automatically updates location information by utilizing the Google Maps API. Any changes in location will be informed by providing a link to directions, travel distance, and travel time between the sender and receiver locations.

In addition, this application has the ability to export data to Excel files, both for data that has been successfully updated and data that has not been successful. This provides flexibility for users to perform further analysis or data processing outside the application.

With the integration of Google Maps API, the “Logistic Tracking” application provides a better understanding of the logistics journey, ensuring efficiency and accuracy in every shipment.
